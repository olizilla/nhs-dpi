# Digital Public Infrastructure in the NHS

_Draft Concept Note - August 2025_

The NHS has [242 published, active, legally required digital standards](https://standards.nhs.uk/published-standards?order=asc&orderBy=name&mandated=true&status=active) for software vendors to adhere to, yet interoperability within its vast ecosystem remains elusive. What is missing? The current landscape of isolated systems and fragmented data, frustrates both healthcare professionals and patients, and stifles innovation.

The goal of this research project is to identify what is preventing these existing digital standards and protocols from delivering an interoperable digital ecosystem and to offer concrete policy proposals to improve the situation.

The primary output will be a published report, informed by a literature review to surface the existing understanding of what is and isnâ€™t working today, along with 10+ interviews with domain experts and two workshops to test the proposals and iterate based on feedback from active practitioners in the space.

The report will examine the political economy of the NHS and how it intersects with the tools and processes of software engineering to discover why a protocols- and standards-based approach to digital transformation has not taken off yet, despite evident investment in standards and devolved authority to choose different solutions, which should already be selecting for interoperability as a feature.
